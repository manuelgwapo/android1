            Notre Dame – RVM College of Cotabato has its beginning from the Escuela Catolica founded by the Beatas (now R.V.M. Sisters) S. Isabel Cero Mojado, S. Valentina Lorenzo, S. Filomina Galos and S. Severina Santos who were sent by the Superior General of the Beatas, Reverend Efigenia Alvarez, in 1904. The first classes were held at the home of Don Antonio and Doña Eusebia Sousa, the generous benefactors of the Sisters.<br /><br />
            
            In 1917, the school obtained the government recognition and was granted the authority to issue certificates to the elementary school graduates. The subject taught were Christian Doctrines, Reading and Writing, Drawing and Painting, and the Home Arts for Girls. Until 1911, all instructions were in Spanish. When English became the medium of instruction, Spanish continued to be taught as a subject in all classes of all levels.<br /><br />
            
            The school underwent several name changing from Escuela Catolica to Escuela de San Antonio, Colegio de los Corazones Y Maria and finally Cotabato Parochial School which it bore until World War II stopped its operation.<br /><br />
            
            After the war, the sisters organized pre-school and elementary classes under the name St. Anthony School. S. Maria Aquino secured spaces for classes in the ground floor of friends and benefactors, which the school used until the old school was rebuilt.<br /><br />
            
            In 1947, Archbishop Mongeau, then the O.M.I. Father Superior, founded the Notre Dame of Cotabato a co-educational Catholic High School which in 1948 was separated into Boys Department and Girls Department. The Marist Bothers, taking over the Boys remained in the original site of the sister’s school. The RVM Sisters under the leadership of Sister M. Isabel Purification, RVM moved to the present site where the elementary school and high school for girls were fused into the Notre Dame of Cotabato – Girls Department which later became Notre Dame of Cotabato for Girls in 1979.<br /><br />
            
            In the School Year 1969 – 1974, to meet the standard of its clientele, an additional building was constructed in the campus, which was named as Mother Tan Building. This served as the mini-auditorium, where school programs such as stage plays, operettes, etc. were held and at the same time served as the classrooms of the high school students.<br /><br />
            
            In the School Year 1986 – 1990, as a response to the rapid increase in the school’s population, the administrators, under the able leadership of S. Ma. Remedios P. Reduta, RVM and S. Ma. Anecita C. Navaja, RVM, received blessings from its benefactors most specially from Rev. Archbishop Philip Smith, OMI, DD, hence, the Archbishop Philip Smith Building (BSB1, BSB2), were constructed and serve as the High School Department Buildings.<br /><br />
            
            In 1994 – 1998, with the efforts of S. Ma. Lourdes A. Darilag, RVM, Directress, and the generosity of Archbishop Smith, OMI, DD, the school was granted another building which is now the BSB3, occupied by the Grade school pupils. This was followed by the construction of the school’s gymnasium and mini-park.<br /><br />
            
            
            The desire to pursue quality education for its clientele was initially fulfilled when in 1987; the High School Department had its first PAASCU Accreditation while the Grade School Department had theirs in the year 2000.<br /><br />
            
            In 1984, the Grade School Department started to accept boys, while in 2000, the high school Department had its first group of boys, too. After twenty – three years, that is, in school year 2002 – 2003, the school again underwent another change of name, Notre Dame – RVM School of Cotabato.<br /><br />
            
            
            School Year 2002 – 2003 was a milestone to remember in the history of this institution. Various improvements happened this year under the leadership of S. Ma. Zosima N. Capua, RVM, the Directress. It saw the completion of the new four-storey Mother Ignacia Building which houses the Fourth Year classes, the air-conditioned library and the Speech and Internet laboratories. The Home Economics laboratory was also renovated into a mini-hotel complete with amenities. The School Chapel underwent a total face-lift. Now, it is a haven of quite and serenity. It has become a place more conducive to prayer and reflection.<br /><br />
            
            With the school’s endless desire to improve and offer the community a better quality of service in the field of education, it opened its portals to college education in the school year 2003 – 2004. Two short-term courses were opened, Hotel and Restaurant management (2 years) and Caregiver Program (6months). All classes were held in the new building.<br /><br />
            
            As the school readied itself for its centennial celebration in the school year 2004-2005, it anticipated fruitful year in its service towards the people of Cotabato and its neighboring towns and provinces. It is in this school year that the name was changed to Notre Dame – RVM College of Cotabato. In the same year, application for additional courses was made, to wit: a) Bachelor of Elementary Education (BEEd) and b) Bachelor of Secondary Education (BSEd) majors in: 1) English, 2) Filipino, 3) Mathematics, and 4) Physical Sciences (Physics and Chemistry).<br /><br />

            In school year 2008-2009, the school had a new administrator, S. Ma. Charita P. Cabunoc, RVM. She is the Second President of the College Department, Directress for Basic Education and the Principal of the Grade School Department. In this year, she led the Grade School Department in the preparation for their PAASCU revisit.<br /><br />
            
            
            To meet the demands of quality education and global competitiveness, the ND-RVMCC acquired an institutional asset which will provide better experiential learning for its growing number of students. The asset was the former fast food joint in front of the school. This was bought by the institution last January 2008. This is the Hotel and Restaurant Management Laboratory of the college students taking up the course of Hotel and Restaurant Management.<br /><br />
            
            Looking into the recreational needs of the pupils, the administration has come up with the construction of the Water Park. It has been operational since last February 2010 with the Kindergarten pupils as the first customers.<br /><br />

            Being a Catholic Christian School in the midst of a highly Muslim dominated populace, it takes pride in the formation of its people and in extending its services to both Christian and Muslims alike. It still hopes to give its best as it continues to respond to the needs and realities of the present moment alongside with globalization and technology.
